// This file is intentionally left empty.
// The core gateway logic is implemented directly within the
// `gateway` directory files (e.g., gateway-server.ts, api-resolver.ts, etc.)
// and integrated into the Next.js route handler `app/api/gateway/[...path]/route.ts`.
// This structure allows for a more direct and efficient integration
// with Next.js's API routes and serverless functions.
// No separate 'gateway-core.ts' class is needed as a wrapper.
